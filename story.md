# The Last Commit

Lena sat at her cluttered desk, the soft hum of her computer fan filling the silence of the late-night office. The glow of her screen illuminated the dark room, and all that stood between her and the project's final release was a single commit. She ran her fingers through her tangled hair and stared at the blinking cursor in the terminal. It was supposed to be a simple fix — a bug that should have been resolved hours ago — but something was holding her back.

The terminal was her friend, her constant companion during these late-night coding sessions, but tonight it felt like a mirror reflecting all her doubts. "git commit -m 'Fix bug in user profile page' — she typed the message out a dozen times, then erased it every time. She couldn't quite shake the feeling that this last change wasn’t just a bug fix. It was something bigger, something final. Like pushing this code would send a part of herself into the ether, an irreversible decision.
